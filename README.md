# ASCII-ART

## _Ascii-art is a program which consists in receiving a string as an argument and outputting the string in a graphic representation using ASCII._

## Instructions

 - Your project must be written in Go.

 - The code must respect the good practices.

 - It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.

 - Some banner files with a specific graphical template representation using ASCII will be given. The files are formatted in a way that is not necessary to change them.

    -   shadow
    -   standard
    -   thinkertoy


## Banner Format

 - Each character has a height of 8 lines.
 - Characters are separated by a new line \n.
 - Here is an example of ' ', '!' and '"'(one dot represents one space):

 ```sh
......
......
......
......
......
......
......
......

._..
|.|.
|.|.
|.|.
|_|.
(_).
....
....

```

## For RUN

Usage: 

```sh
$ go run . "your text" | cat -e

                                      _                   _    $
                                     | |                 | |   $
